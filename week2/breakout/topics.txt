Closure (how to take advantage / screw yourself)
	- See main.js

Approach to creating a website from scratch (context of midterm or similar application)
	
	DISCOVERY
		- Most websites are NOT just static content
			- What features need to go into your application?
			- What do users need to be able to do?  What does an average use case look like? (
				Recipe app : 
					Users need to be able to look for and see recipes.  
					Users need to be able to create and share recipes
				)
		- Storyboard / User Stories
			- Tied to your feature list
			- Stories about what a user should be able to do
				(As a USER I need to be able to ...)
			- MAY want to separate into CORE vs NICE TO HAVE
	
	DO IT (building ALL the things)
		- UI/UX planning
			- Sketching out UI components you need to build (
				Recipe App : 
					search,
					add a recipe,
					buttons,
					modals,
					etc
			)
			- Colors, fonts, layout, etc 
			- Sketch, Autodesk Graphic, Adobe Fireworks, PixelMator, GIMP, Invision, Balsamiq
			- Finalize designs, styleguide

		- Dev
			- Organizing a hierarchy of importance based on your feature list.  Work on the CORE first, then the NICE TO HAVE
			
			- Pick a page and start with it (homepage?)
				- A simpler page will allow you to focus on the HTML layout and CSS styling so that you can be consistent throughout your app.

			- From here people diverge
				- May want to do ALL HTML/CSS before adding JS
				- May want to work on a component by component basis (styling the search bar and making it functional while the rest of the page stays unstyled)







Puzzle Pieces - MEAN stack

Functional Programming - when it's appropriate
	Arithmetic
	Creating NEW sets of data without changing the OLD data
	Data transformation = [
		street address -> lat/lng,
		charts/graphs,
	]
NON-Functional (destructive)
myArr  => ['dog', 'cat', 'mouse', 'parrot']
var change = myArr.splice(0, 3, 'T-rex', 'Snake')
change => ['dog', 'cat', 'mouse']
myArr  => ['parrot', 'T-rex', 'Snake']
